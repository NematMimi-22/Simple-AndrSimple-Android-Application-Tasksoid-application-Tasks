# Simple-Android-Application-Task


Task One:
This task aim to create an Android application that includes a Switch widget, a set of buttons, and two text views (Input and Output). The Switch widget controls whether the buttons are enabled or disabled. You also need to implement a man character that moves and performs actions based on a series of given commands, which are listed in a table (see the Task file).


Task Two:
This task aim to create an Android application that allows users to add boats and sailors to a database using different activities. The application should have a Main Activity with five buttons, two of which navigate to the Add Boat and Add Sailor activities, respectively. The other three buttons are used to perform queries on the database and display the results on the Main Activity.
The Boat table has three columns: Boat ID, Boat Name, and Color. The Sailor table has four columns: Sailor ID, Boat ID, Name, and Nationality. Boat ID is a foreign key in the Sailor table that references the Boat ID in the Boat table.
When the user adds a boat, the Boat ID should be auto-generated, and the user should be able to input the Boat Name and select the color from a spinner with four options. Similarly, when the user adds a sailor, the Sailor ID should be auto-generated, and the user should be able to input the Name and select the Nationality from a spinner with three options.
The three buttons for performing queries should display the following information on the Main Activity:
Button 3: List the number of sailors for each nationality.
Button 4: List the name of the boats in red color.
Button 5: List Palestinian sailor names who have a red boat.


Task Three:
This Task requires you to design an Android application using Android Studio software. The application should consist of an activity that contains three fragments.
 The first fragment has two Plain Texts, a Text View, and a Button. The user enters two numbers in the Plain Texts. When the Button in the first fragment is pressed, the summation of the two numbers is displayed in the second fragment Text View. Additionally, the multiplication of the two numbers is displayed in the third fragment Text View.
Pressing the Button in the second fragment increments the summation result by 1 and displays it in the first fragment Text View. Pressing the Button in the third fragment decrements the multiplication result by 1 and displays it in the first fragment Text View.
In summary, this ToDo aims to enhance your knowledge about Fragments and Inter-Fragment communication design pattern.
